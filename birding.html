          <li class="poem-li">I know why the caged bird sings, ah me,</li>
          <li class="poem-li">When his wing is bruised and his bosom sore,--</li>
          <li class="poem-li">When he beats his bars and he would be free;</li>
          <li class="poem-li">It is not a carol of joy or glee,</li>
          <li class="poem-li">But a prayer that he sends from his heart's deep core,</li>
          <li class="poem-li">But a plea, that upward to Heaven he flings--</li>
          <li class="poem-li">I know why the caged bird sings!</li>

        <h2>Common Birds of Kauai</h2>
        <ul>
          <li class="bird-name">Common Myna (Acridotheres tristis): 
            <ul>
              <li class="bird-info">Common mynas are described as tame, gregarious, and bold, and engage in allopreening within mated pairs. When foraging, these mynas hop sideways and saunter along the ground and on branches. Common mynas have also been observed participating in anting with fire ants.
              </li>
              <li class="bird-info">Both females and males sing, but males sing more frequently. Common mynas also participate in loud dawn and dusk choruses</li>
            </ul>  
          </li>
          <li class="bird-name">Zebra Dove (Geopelia striata):
            <ul class="bird-info">
              <li>the Zebra Dove was introduced in 1922 and by the 1930’s were common on all the main islands but the Big Island which they eventually colonized as well. They are quite tame and can be seen courting and feeding around any outdoor restaurant or park.</li>
              <li>Male and female Zebra Doves look similar and do not have any distinct patterns. Zebra Doves have blue facial skin and gray to light brown feathers. Their underside ranges from light-gray to pink.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li class="bird-name"> House Sparrow (Passer Domesticus)
            <ul>
              <li class="bird-info">Most house sparrow vocalisations are variations on its short and incessant chirping call. Transcribed as chirrup, tschilp, or philip, this note is made as a contact call by flocking or resting birds, or by males to proclaim nest ownership and invite pairing. In the breeding season, the male gives this call repetitively, with emphasis and speed, but not much rhythm, forming what is described either as a song or an "ecstatic call" similar to a song.</li>
              <li class="bird-info">The house sparrow is a very social bird. It is gregarious during all seasons when feeding, often forming flocks with other species of birds.[101] It roosts communally and while breeding nests are usually grouped together in clumps. House sparrows also engage in social activities such as dust or water bathing and "social singing", in which birds call together in bushes.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li class="bird-name">Red-crested Cardinal (Paroaria coronata)
            <ul>
              <li class="bird-info">The red-crested cardinal is native to Argentina, Bolivia, southern Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. It has also been introduced to Hawaii and Puerto Rico.</li>
             <li class="bird-info">Red-crested cardinals live 3 to 6 years in the wild and about 13 years in human care.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li class="bird-name">Saffron Finch (Sicalis flaveola)
            <ul>
              <li class="bird-info">Carolus Linneaeus first described the Saffron Finch in 1766.</li>
              <li class="bird-info">They may become more aggressive during breeding; in some cases, cock birds have been known to kill their mates or juveniles. </li>
