        <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>There are around 10,000 different species of birds worldwide.</li>
          <li>Birds have hollow bones which help them fly.</li>
          <li>The common Myna bird is vilified throughout Hawai'i as noisy and quarrelsome.  At their worst, they have set buildings on fire with lighted cigarettes! </li>
          <li>The chicken is the most common species of bird found in the world.  On Kauai, chickens can be found throughout neighborhoods, side of nearly every road, and sometimes wander into restaurants and shops!</li>
          <li>The largest population of Hawaii's state bird, the Nene Goose, is found on Kauai.</li>
          <li>Ravens are great at mimicking human sound and speech. In captivity, they have been observed making noises that resemble car engines revving and toilets flushing.</li>
          <li>Cardinals like to cover themselves in ants.  Scientists still aren't sure what "anting" accomplishes but suspect that ant baths provide secreted acid that helps get rid of lice and other parasites.</li>
          <li>Ducks sometimes sleep with one eye open.  This occurs when ducks sleep in groups, with those on the exterior keeping guard while the interior ducks enjoy restful beauty sleep.</li>
          <li>There are 71 known taxa of birds endemic to the Hawaiian Islands, of which 30 are extinct.</li>
        </ul>
